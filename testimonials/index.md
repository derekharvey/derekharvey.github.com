Below are some testimonials i have received from some of my students i am teaching.

### Bill H. 17 April 2008

Derek has been teaching me for the better part of a year. With over thirty years experience he teaches how to play without the pitfalls and bad habits of going it alone. I heartily recommend him.

I have always wanted to learn how to play the acoustic guitar, but i never managed to find the time to arrange guitar lessons. That’s the great thing about Derek, he comes to me! It is so convenient for my life style, i have only had a few lessons now but i feel i’m making real progress. Thanks Derek!

### Del H. 17th January 2010

I never thought i’d be able to play the guitar but after the initial lessons i found that i could play. Now i can pick up a guitar and know how to use it, i really do enjoy playing. Thank you so much.
